# Exploring BMO Mutual Funds
## by Luca Zhou

Investment is a field that requires lifelong learning, and I'd like to start earlier. The primary purpose of this project is to explore all BMO mutual funds and create a stable portfolio for my future financial independence. This project consists of three parts:

1. **Data wrangling**: collect and clean the data into a playable format.
2. **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**: supplement statistics with appropriate plots to understand the distributions and relationships.
3. **Communicate my findings**: implement a dynamic dashboard for communicating insights.
