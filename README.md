# Exploring BMO Mutual Funds
## by Luca Zhou

Investment is a field that requires lifelong learning, and I'd like to start earlier. The primary purpose of this project is to explore all BMO mutual funds performances data using **Jupyter Notebook** and build a stable portfolio for my future financial independence. This project consists of three parts:

1. **Data wrangling**: collect and clean the data into a playable format. If you wonder how the data collection and cleaning is done, see ["DataWrangling.ipynb"](https://github.com/chefZau/Exploring-BMO-MFunds/blob/main/DataWrangling.ipynb) for more detail.
2. **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**: supplement statistics with appropriate plots to understand the distributions and relationships. Notice that the file ["EDA.ipynb"](https://github.com/chefZau/Exploring-BMO-MFunds/blob/main/EDA.ipynb) contains the detailed exploration process.
3. **Communicate my findings**: implement a dynamic dashboard for communicating insights.

## Prerequisite

The project was built using **Python 3**, and the primary IDE is **Jupyter Notebook**. To follow along, I recommend installing the [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html) distribution since it includes all necessary Python libraries and Jupyter Notebook. The following libraries are expected to be used in this project:

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

Notice that in the data wrangling section, web scraping is needed. Here are the essential libraries I used for extracting and parsing web data:

* [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)
* [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io) (make sure you download the driver)
* [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
